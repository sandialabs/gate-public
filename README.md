# GATE-PUBLIC

## Requirements

*  A CUDA capable GPU. You can verify if you have one by checking in device manager for a display adapter that is an NVIDIA product. Then check if your product is CUDA enabled [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus#compute).
*  A CUDA compiler (this repo has been tested on Windows with nvcc CUDA 10.1 and 10.2). No guarantees for other CUDA versions. Linux is currently not supported, but will be in the near future.
*  MSVC 2017 or 2019 with C/C++ tool and CMake integration. (See Notes 1.)

### Notes

1.  Information about CMake integration with Microsoft Visual Studio can be found for [2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2017) and for [2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019)
2.  Download CUDA from Nvidia's [website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

## Building and Running

Open the repository folder in Microsoft Visual Studio. The CMakeCache should automatically be generated, then you should be able to build any of the cmake targets in Release configuration. Debug is currently not supported.

To verify the build, run any of the examples in \gate-public\gate\examples, e.g., gate_quad_main.exe.

## Usage

See examples in \gate-public\gate\examples for usage. A user is required to create a dynamics class, a controller class, and a perturbations class. See our tutorial paper for further details:
